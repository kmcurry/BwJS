Bridgeworks for JavaScript

Bridgeworks is a runtime engine for rendering well-formed markup as 3D/4D, interactive views (fourth dimension is time, i.e., animation). 

Bridgeworks can be used to render high fidelity models, maps, terrain, link analysis graphs, and statistical charts.

This implementation of Bridgeworks, bwjs, is a JavaScript version of our C++ engine. 

bwjs utilizes WebGL to render in a web browser without installing a plugin. Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Bridgeworks runs on Windows and Mac and is under development for iOS.
